nes tilehex to array text is a tool that i made bc i required to make
string data quicky so here we are :)

this tool converts from characters to tile data inside an array with the name you want.

im using this only for neslib, if it does or doesn't help you with something is not my care

there are instructions and a sample of usage of this tool, i hope you have fun!!

...

wait i forgot, you must have this in mind in order to use this...

inside the text.txt you can write the name of the array on top, then on bottom the string data you need
(i guess this doesn't matter since you are going to see the sample anyways lol)
